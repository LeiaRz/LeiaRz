ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Leia, a sprout from the beautiful Data Science tree.
I haven't fully learned to use the Force of Data, but I possess all the midi-chlorians needed to do so in the nearest future.
As the universe expands, my thirst for knowledge and analytics grows in parallel.

ðŸŒ± I'm currently taking my first steps towards Machine Learning with Python, mainly involved in Data Analysis projects.

ðŸ‘€ I'm particularly interested in Astro-Dataâ€”anything that has been or will be discovered by Hubble or James Webb.

ðŸŒŒ I'm deeply in love with science fiction, from the lightsaber duels of Lucas to the futuristic AI civilizations of Asimov.
I know "Star Wars" isn't exactly classified as science fiction, but come on, the Force is like a cherry on top of space adventures.
Anyway, I'd love to collaborate on any project related to this topic.
